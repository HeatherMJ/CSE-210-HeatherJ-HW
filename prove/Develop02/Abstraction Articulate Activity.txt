What is abstraction and why is it important?
Your response must:

1.  Explain the meaning of Abstraction: 
The purpose of abstraction is to take difficult/complex concepts and produce simplier
code. Abstraction also creates well structured code and also increases the security of 
the program becaue it will only giving the most important details to the user. 

2. Highlight a benefit of Abstraction:

Abstraction allows reusing code in muliple areas by using different classes.

3.  Provide an application of Abstraction:
An example of application of Abstraction would be by creating a higher order of 
code, this will allow classes to share with others.

4.Use a code example of Abstraction from the program you wrote:
public void DisplayAll()
    {
        foreach (var entry in entries)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(entry);
        }
    }
Here you see that we use this Display All to display all the journal entries.  The user will be using this method to diplay the journal 
entries.  This enables them to create entries without having to know how the entries are received and formatted.
Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)
